# Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) Tutorial

![Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima](./wavelet.png)

## Introduction

The Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) method is a powerful tool in signal processing and fractal analysis. It allows for the detection of singularities in signalsâ€”points where the signal behaves unusually, such as sharp transitions or changes in frequency. These singularities often correspond to critical features in the data, making WTMM particularly useful in various fields, including physics, biology, and finance.

The WTMM method leverages the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to decompose a signal into different scales, making it possible to analyze its behavior at multiple resolutions. By identifying the maxima of the wavelet transform (modulus maxima), the WTMM method constructs a "skeleton" of the signal, which highlights the locations of these singularities across different scales.

## Motivation

Understanding singularities is crucial for analyzing complex signals that exhibit fractal properties, such as turbulence, stock market data, or biomedical signals like EEG. Traditional Fourier analysis often falls short in detecting these localized features because it provides information about the frequency content of the entire signal but lacks the resolution to capture changes at specific points. In contrast, the WTMM method offers a multi-scale analysis, allowing for a more detailed examination of the signal's structure and the identification of critical points.

This repository provides a step-by-step tutorial on applying the WTMM method to different types of signals, including those with interesting fractal properties like the Weierstrass function. By following this tutorial, you will gain an intuitive understanding of the WTMM method and how to implement it using Python.
